The following excel sheet files are used to assess space compliance as described in the publication: An Open-Source Tool for Navigating Space Compliance. The excel sheets will contain Visual Basic Application macros that will require enabling before using the user forms. To start the tool, go under the "Welcome!" sheet to begin the surveys. There are two main buttons that will activate two main branches of the space compliance framework. Both buttons will be labeled appropriately. Moreover, the user forms have instructions for how to fill everything out. In general the process is as follows: click a button to activate the user form, input the information needed on the user form, start the appropriate survey using the button descriptions, and submit the information using the appropriate button. 

In terms of using the tool, it is open for anyone to modify as needed such as adding or removing questions for the questionnaires. In particular, the tool is meant to facilitate the assessment of space compliance, and it is understood that changes will be needed depending on the industry the tool is used in.
